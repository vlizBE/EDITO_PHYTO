# EDITO_PHYTO
This repository contains the code from the Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus model developed under the Blue-Cloud and is used here for for the EDITO project.

The processed data and scripts have also been published in the Blue-Cloud Catalogue (https://data.d4science.org/ctlg/Zoo-Phytoplankton_EOV/spatiotemporal_analysis_of_plankton_drivers_in_the_belgian_part_of_the_north_sea_data, accessed on 10 March 2023), as well as deposited in Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6794084, accessed on 10 March 2023) under a Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license.
